# Windows 10 settings master script

This is currently a work in progress so probably not much use for you, yet...

The goal here is to make one long batch file containing all common settings in Windows 10. That way we can use it as a reference or a "go-to script" when making a template for our own user.

Imagine making a new user account in Windows, double clicking a BAT file, and voilÃ  -you have all your custom settings applied ðŸ˜²
